# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

This repository is a collection of algorithms grouped by data structure. Following the Geeks for Geeks course, some LeetCode exercises and the [Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition](https://www.amazon.com.br/Introduction-Algorithms-Fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X/ref=asc_df_026204630X) book.

The implementations are in Golang and C (extra challenge)
